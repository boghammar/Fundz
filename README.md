# Fundz
This is an experimental system for handling stock fund strategies based on simple SMA analysis. The idea is from a thread at FlashBack where different fund strategies are discussed.

The application is a Node.js based application built around Express with ??? as view template engine. It gets the fund daily quotes from the inofficial Avanza API's that has been gracefully reversengineered by the guy in the FlashBack thread.
